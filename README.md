# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

> This is a repository of high-level projects, where I explore object-oriented programming
  in Python, databases with MySQL, and frontend with JavaScript. The objective is to learn high-level concepts
  and apply them in practical projects. Also, I made this project to build the project of replicating the Airbnb
  app, or some of its features, and I needed this knowledge for the backend database, the API, and the frontend.
